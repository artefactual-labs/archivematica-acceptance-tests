Feature: Ingest policy check
  Archivists want to check that the files that are defined for access or
  preservation conform to a pre-defined policy (or policies). The access and
  preservation derivatives may have been created by Archivematica through
  normalization or may have been predefined by the user prior to
  transfer.

  @access @nonmanual
  Scenario Outline: Isla has access derivatives and she needs to know whether they conform to her access policy
    Given a processing configuration for policy checks on access derivatives
    And MediaConch policy file <policy_file> is present in the local etc/mediaconch-policies/ directory
    And directory <transfer_path> contains files that, when normalized, will all <do_files_conform> to <policy_file>
    When the user ensures there is an FPR command that uses policy file <policy_file>
    And the user ensures there is an FPR rule with purpose <purpose> that validates Generic MKV files against policy file <policy_file>
    And the user edits the FPR rule to transcode .mkv files to .mkv for access
    And a transfer is initiated on directory <transfer_path>
    And the user waits for the "Policy checks for access derivatives" micro-service to complete during ingest
    Then the "Policy checks for access derivatives" micro-service output is "<microservice_output>" during ingest
    And all policy check for access derivatives tasks indicate <event_outcome>
    When the user waits for the AIP to appear in archival storage
    And the user downloads the AIP
    And the user decompresses the AIP
    Then the submissionDocumentation directory of the AIP does not contain a copy of the MediaConch policy file <policy_file>

    Examples: Policy Check Outcomes
