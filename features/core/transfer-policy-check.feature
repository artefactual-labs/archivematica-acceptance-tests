Feature: Transfer policy check
  Archivists want to check that the original files they transfer conform to a
  pre-defined policy/policies before proceeding with further digital
  preservation actions.

  Scenario Outline: Isla has started a transfer of files and needs to know if they conform to her policy for original files.
    Given a processing configuration for policy checks on originals
    And MediaConch policy file <policy_file> is present in the local etc/mediaconch-policies/ directory
    And directory <transfer_path> contains files that all do <do_files_conform> to <policy_file>
    When the user ensures there is an FPR command that uses policy file <policy_file>
    And the user ensures there is an FPR rule with purpose <purpose> that validates Generic MKV files against policy file <policy_file>
    And a transfer is initiated on directory <transfer_path>
    And the user waits for the "Policy checks for originals" micro-service to complete during transfer
    Then the "Policy checks for originals" micro-service output is "<microservice_output>" during transfer
    And all policy check for originals tasks indicate <event_outcome>
    When the user waits for the AIP to appear in archival storage
    And the user downloads the AIP
    And the user decompresses the AIP
    # TODO: where does the transfer policy check policy end up?
    #Then the submissionDocumentation directory of the AIP contains a copy of the MediaConch policy file <policy_file>
    Then the transfer logs directory of the AIP contains a MediaConch policy check output file for each policy file tested against <policy_file>

  Examples: Policy Check Outcomes
    | do_files_conform | microservice_output    | event_outcome  | verification_result | transfer_path                          | policy_file                       | purpose                     |
    | conform          | Completed successfully | pass           | successful          | TestTransfers/acceptance-tests/preforma/all-conform-policy-originals  | NYULibraries_MKVFFV1-MODIFIED.xsl | Validation against a policy |
    | not conform      | Failed                 | fail           | failed              | TestTransfers/acceptance-tests/preforma/none-conform-policy-originals | NYULibraries_MKVFFV1-MODIFIED.xsl | Validation against a policy |
